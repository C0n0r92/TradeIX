Hi!

You can run this at the command line by using installing gradlew (brew install gradle should work)

Then ./gradlew clean build test 

1 test is failing as the API returns the wrong response but I've outlined that in my comments

If you wish to debug the tests just open them In an IDE and run the green junit arrow beside each test.

Any questions get me at conormcloughlin1992@gmail.com
